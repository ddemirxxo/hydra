<blockquote><h1>Its real</h1><p>Ive drempt of seeing you again.</p><p>And spent my waking hours day dreaming about seeing you again. </p><p>My hands ache when I think of holding yours. My arms shake when i imagine them around you.</p><p>My head swirls when I picture your smile and lets not even talk about the crushing pressure I get on my chest when I imagine your lips on mine.</p><p>There was a time in my life you were all i knew, then the time came when you were dragged from my reach, my sight and the weeks until I saw you again were a blur of the worst pain ive ever felt, a emptiness I thought would kill me. </p><p>I lost everything after I lost you, from people to hope. </p><p>Your very existence seemed to be what my humanity relied on.</p><p>I don’t know if I destroyed everything I had over the next few months or if the universe wouldn’t allow me anything without your presence.</p><p>I found out you were out of the cage that kept you out of my arms but that didn’t change the barrier pulling us apart.</p><p>I filled my lungs with so much smoke trying to forget you</p><p>Thinking you were better off.</p><p>Knowing while my life was progressively deteriorating, my heart felt nothing but cold nights warm hands from strangers.</p><p>The more people I got lost in the more my hands would ache, my arms shook and the pressure on my chest became so unbearable that I stopped filling my lungs with smoke and put a needle in my veins. </p><p>I figured maybe then I could feel my heart, it goes straight to it rite? My tolerance and desperate need to feel meant there were weeks my hands didn’t ache and the strangers were enough and the pressure in my chest was now just a deadly blood born virus, stemming from my heart valve. </p><p>I remeber the first time we spoke when I was in hospital. </p><p>It was the cleanest I had been since they took you away. </p><p>I was a skeleton, I had withdrawals yet</p><p>My arms didn’t shake, my hands did ache but you took the pressure, the pain and the toxins rite out of me.</p><p>I already knew you were my forever, my greatest loss. </p><p>That night I played with the idea that maybe I hadn’t lost you. </p><p>It didn’t last long and before I let it sink in the biggest battle for my life had begun.</p></blockquote>
