                    <p>I’m afraid that if someone were to take a scalpel to my skin and pull, all that would erupt from my veins would be my fears, regrets and your name, tucked quietly into their corners so nobody would know how fervently I ache.</p>

<p>Today, in your absence, my heart knew not what to do with its hands. Tomorrow it will write you another poem you will never come to see. <br/>
Day after, it will wear a straitjacket to try and set you free before it is Saturday night and once again, the vicious cycle of letting you go will begin.</p>

<p>I’ll miss you all the time. That’s what i’m trying to say. </p>
