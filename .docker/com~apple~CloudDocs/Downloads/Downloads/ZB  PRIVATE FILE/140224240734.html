                                    <h1>breaking point</h1>
                    <p>To feel although you are on the verge of breaking. Its a drastic saying really, how many of us have truly been broken? like, we aren’t made of glass. </p>

<p>I personally don’t think one can really break, that’s literal speaking of course.</p>

<p>If I was to be so bold and use that term to describe how I was feeling in any time of my life, I guess this time of my life would be as good as any. </p>

<p>I am very aware I am made of multiple layers apon structures built specifically just not to ‘break’ <br/>
So sure, the very bones in my body have trembled under the weight of a thousand problems and my skin has been stretched, split and even cracked attempting to conceal bare knuckles after days of clenches fists and yes, the muscles that trace my jawline and up my cheeks have twitched and even sagged from exhastion while the bone itself inside my scull has felt like an atomic bomb just hit but was forced to restrict the explosion right between my ears while my brain succumbed to the rumble of my forever irrational thoughts.</p>

<p>some might call that &lsquo;breaking point’ </p>

<p>sure, broken would sound like the correct term one would use after experiencing the list above. <br/>
If it were a building, a car or boat.<br/>
I might crumble, but im no building.<br/>
I might run on empty but I’m not a car.<br/>
I have sunk beyond the depths of despair and that would’ve sucked, if I was a boat.</p>

<p>Instead I am a human.<br/>
Top of the food chain in the world we live with our only known predators being our very own thoughts.</p>

<p>Built to bent and snap and dismantle every fibre of ourselves or ones around us yet seemingly fucking indestructible.</p>

<p>How annoying, breaking point for the unbreakable, only knows of broken as a descriptive word for all that wont ever break.</p>
