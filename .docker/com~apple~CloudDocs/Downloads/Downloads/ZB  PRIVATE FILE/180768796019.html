Imagine if each regret you ever had was smeared on your skin for the world to see??</p><p>Guess it wouldn&rsquo;t matter what you imagined, we will never experience any of these things. </p><p>We are masters of deception and even more so in creating distractions.</p><p>What matters is that I would write down every lie I have ever told, I would spit out every broken promise and tattoo every regret I ever experienced onto my body for you to see. I know vulnerability is a necessity for people to gain connection and insight, I just don&rsquo;t understand why vulnerability makes me crazy.</p><p>Maybe it’s because im crazy about you</p><p>Or maybe it’s because ive never been vulnerable for anyone else&hellip;.</p>
