                                    <h1>Searching</h1>
                    <p>Looking, seeking. <br/>
Apparently we are all doing it.</p>

<p>Seeking that high to escape our thoughts or lives.</p>

<p>Looking for that thing or person to fill a void we aren’t even sure when or where it originated from.</p>

<p>I don’t like looking or searching because the chances of finding that person or thing means everything that is already in existence, right I front of us, becomes mere objects. Sometimes obstructing our view and prolonging our search.</p>

<p>I love a challenge.</p>

<p>Competition is in my nature and embedded in my bloodline and a strong trait even in my star sign.</p>

<p>So I challenge myself to stand still, I dare to watch the search party disappear out of sight and be left alone with exactly what I already have. The people behind me I forgot about and the ones I’d buried.</p>

<p>Dig up the painful memories and corpses of the once loved humans I suppressed six feet under.</p>

<p>Put the bones of my enemies back in order while I brace myself for the inevitable sharp and crippling memories of every painful experience, every situation and person that has moulded me into the very person I am today, the creature of contradictions and unexplained habits that are the make up of my personality. </p>

<p>Good and bad.</p>

<p>I am what I am and I am knee deep in the bones of suppressed occasions. <br/>
I’m smothered in hate and anger.<br/>
My fingers are breaking while I am desperately pulling my fears out of the pits of my history, forcing my eyes to focus on all the things that create the urge to run deep in my chest and cause muscles to twitch on the outsides of my ankles. </p>

<p>I can’t even see the search lights in the distance anymore but now I am blinded by the decisions I’ve made, my eyes are strained from attempting to focus on the million repercussions my actions have created, not all bad, the ratio is surprisingly even. <br/>
But I always did have high a standard when it came to my own and others morals and values, let’s not forget I was always an impeccable liar.</p>

<p>So the bones are in order and the memories aren’t at all but they are laid out amongst the living and the dead, the old and the new.</p>

<p>No wonder we are all searching. </p>

<p>Seeking new and looking for anything to fill the voids.

</p><p>It’s not the pain or the people, it’s not our regrets or even our mistakes that we hide from.<br/>
It’s our own reflection.</p>
