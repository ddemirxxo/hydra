                    <p>I don&rsquo;t know what to say.<br/>
Every time I think I find a reason for how I feel, I manage to find a reason that it&rsquo;s something else.</p>

<p>I have not thought about how it must feel for you, how much my body language has spoken words for me.</p>

<p>I am sorry.</p>

<p>You are all I know now.</p>

<p>There is so much pain in our past that I have yet to face that when I feel detached or down, all the things that you ever did or said to me just come in waves.</p>

<p>So no, it&rsquo;s not you.</p>

<p>But while you are all thats around me, my head relates my emotions around us.</p>

<p>I am lost.</p>

<p>We are ok.</p>

<p>I can keep on, I could stay on auto pilot for months.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m concerned about.</p>

<p>There is so much inside you that you have carried alone.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t help but feel I don&rsquo;t care, that I don&rsquo;t see.</p>

<p>I can see and feel everything around me more than ever.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s my body, mind and head that can no longer adjust.</p>

<p>Nothing matches, it&rsquo;s like I was a puppet and someone has cut the strings that used to make me, me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be ok, I know I&rsquo;ll be ok.</p>

<p>We just need to get you better so I can figure out what I need to get better.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how I work now, that&rsquo;s how it has to be for now.</p>

<p>Stay strong baby.</p>

<p>I am weak where you have strength.<br/>
I am strong where you are weakest.</p>

<p>We will get threw this xoxoxox</p>
