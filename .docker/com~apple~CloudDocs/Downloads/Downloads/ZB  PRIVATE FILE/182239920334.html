                    <p>If I count to ten, how quickly do you think you could hide your fears?</p><p>Would you even have the courage to pull them from the void in your stomach and risk them being exposed in the first place??</p><p>Could you trust me enough to tell me how many fears you even have?? </p><p>I would hate to leave one behind afterall</p><p>I do hope that when i count down that maybe you hadn’t trick me?? </p><p>I mean, it does go against pretty much every mammal’s basic instincts rite?? To  dare to expose their fears?? To dig deep into our very core and drag out everything we speant a lifetime burying?? </p><p>Fuck, i do hope you remembered to count your fears, jotted exactly how many you were able to surface.</p><p>Before you hid them threwout the house, while i was still counting down??</p><p>It would defeat the purpose if I left one of then unfound, imagine if i didnt check under the matt in the loungeroom? </p><p>Can you imagine if the neighbors found your deepest fears taped to the bottom of out letterbox??</p><p>I have to admit i would be vigilante in where i hid mine&hellip;</p><p>I hope you learn how to hide your fears inside your bones, study the muscle tissue surrounding your heart and sometimes you even capture them in your lungs and hold your breath. It was never fair of you to do that, I would never reach those places and you knew that. </p><p>I want your hand in mine and I want your fears scattered in hiding spots I am able to reach </p><p>My only fear is never knowing yours </p>
