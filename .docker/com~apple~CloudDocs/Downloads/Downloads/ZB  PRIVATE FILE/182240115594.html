                    <h1>The aftertaste</h1><p>Have you ever tasted regret? </p><p>Its about as easy as explaining fog to blind man</p><p>Or explaining what water tastes like</p><p>Its got a very distinct flavour</p><p>It will leave an aftertaste you never fully recover from</p><p>It lingers with every breathe you take and you will lose majority of your sesne of smell over time</p><p>I remember the first time I got a mouthful of it, im not going to tell you the regret itself but i know the minute it touched my mouth I am certain I have not been able to enjoy food since.</p><p>The regret itself was like any other emotion, all in your head, constant synapses firing all at once threw out your frontal lobe</p><p>Sending random signals to the nerves in your body not really sure how to make us feel the correct pain, after all it is not physical is it? Like the saying ‘broken heart’</p><p>We know it’s physically impossible to have a broken heart. There is no doubt it would cause immediate death.</p><p>Yet too mant times do we wish death might be easier to deal with in comparison </p><p>Lets not forget the insane battle between our heads and our hearts&hellip; another impossible thing, yet we still somehow legitimately think our hearts have some kind of thought process or any fucking conscious input when it comes to any kind of circumstances we are torn between </p><p>So basically, </p><p>No, Im not interested in my head or my heart, its the aftertaste that is still causing me to want to use a razor blade to scrape the build up of regrets off my tongue..</p><p>The regret itself is irrelevant, not because it is not worthy but because its easy to forget where the regret itself even originated while your fucking choking on it. </p><p>The taste is tolerable</p><p>Not enough to make you pull a face like you would after a sour warhead</p><p>Its more the aftertaste, it burns into your gums and smothers your teeth in a thick coat of shame, forever effecting every word that comes out of your mouth. </p><p>After all, shame and regret always team up on me, its never one without the other.</p><p>Im not accustomed to the taste of regret and i am sure as hell exhausted from the layers apon layers of shame that has now become about as natural to me as breathing </p><p>Its guilt I am so desperate for, believe it or not</p><p>Because guilt makes you learn, stops you from making the same mistakes time and time again</p><p>You accept it, be accountable for it and you forgive yourself. </p><p>Can’t say i have ever experienced any of these notions, shame depletes guilt and regret fuels shame. </p><p>You know your fucked up when your 28 and have never felt guilty, not once, yet regret is now your favorite flavor and shame is my primary emotion </p>
