                    <p>It&rsquo;s been a while.</p><p>It&rsquo;s actually been nearly a year since I wrote a dam thing lol Sagittarius are always either over exaggerating or making big things into little things. Why did I start this off with a reminder of my star sign? There is only so much you can blame the pros and cons of your traits on the day you were pushed into this overbearing and underwhelming world we call life. I don&rsquo;t know exactly how old I was when I started using &lsquo;saggi&rsquo; as a legitimate excuse for my irreconcilable behavior but I do know that it has unfortunately worked, really really fucking well. I want to say 'course it did I&rsquo;m a saggi&rsquo; but I&rsquo;ll spare you </p>
