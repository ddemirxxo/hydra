                    <p>I have always felt safer in a hood.<br/>
On the days people would usually seek the comfort of another, i am swimming in a pit of clothes searching for any form of hooded jumper, jacket that has any form of hood like attachment.</p>

<p>You donâ€™t always think you need one until you pull that hood up and over your scull, it restricts your vision and alone automatically soaks me with the sense of less. Just less of the mess that us humans created in the world around me. <br/>
I usually get uncomfortable when i cant see whats around me, especially just to the left or rite of my peripheral, but its a small price to pay.</p>

<p>I find when i push my head back as far as it can go, the crunching of my neck created by multiple cases of whiplash no longer take over my brain as I sink deeper into the oblivion of that hood
