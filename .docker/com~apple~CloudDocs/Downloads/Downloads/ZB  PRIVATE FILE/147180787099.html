                    <h1>Addiction</h1><p>It’s funny that now I’ve been threw so many withdrawal symptoms of so many different narcotics. </p><p>I could copy and paste the way I have felt when I’ve been hurt, lied to or deceived and the description words would match perfectly, I hadn’t consciously gone threw withdrawals before I had written them and now I read over the things I wrote the first time you broke my heart and I am still trying to understand why that hurt, why the exact way my skin crawled, my muscles twitched and my body shuttered is word for word the way withdrawing feels.</p><p>Is love really like a drug or is drugs really like love?</p><p>Does it matter, they should both be illegal.</p><p>I would have been caught the minute i met you from the profound amounts of love I instantly felt and I would be doing three life sentences in a high max prison as we speak. </p><p>Instead of a paper trail the police would just follow the bright red trail of my self destruction or just get a guilt detector and watch the radar direct them straight to my heart.</p><p>When my heart broke the first time, I guess it would be like having a drug addiction taken not just out of your reach but pulled and sucked directly out of your blood stream.</p><p>You hardly have time to react before the withdrawals set in, the shakes cloud your mind while the emptiness drips out what&rsquo;s left of my rational thought. Straight out of the gaping holes in my arms and neck.</p><p>It&rsquo;s weird.  </p><p>I guess weening off love wouldn’t be ideal, although weening off drugs wouldn’t be much better.</p>
