                    <p>It’s a cocktail <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>It’s a potent mix. <br/></p><p>So strong that the ratio in your glass makes no difference to the third degree burns it’ll leave in my throat.</p><p>At least now I have an excuse for never talking, a colorful, yet, half ass reason for being incapable of speech just when they need it most.</p><p> I never did have good excuses, the blistering mess that was once a clearway, free escape used for breathing, the vocal cords and all the vibrations needed for the noises to become distinguished sounds, sounds that form words, words that in my case are picked specifically and slipped perfectly into yet another sentence used for the millionth excuse for my latest action.</p><p><br/></p><p>Glass of irony to wash down my now least favored cocktail.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>It’s a potent mix.</p><p>The strength, before the burn is easily bought to your attention if you dare breathe within 10ft of the glass. Funnily enough I didn’t even breathe until the first mouthful. Because we both know I approach any beverage with confidence and a sense of challenge by nature, so no, I wasn’t aware of the strength and most fucking certainaly was not prepared for a mouthful of my very own medicine. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>That is the irony after all, A potent mix of my anger that caused my guilt and my guilt that infuriates me so much that the third degree burns are welcomed compared to the already liquidated emotions from the last four years burning holes in my digestive system, <br/></p><p>you cunt.</p><p> I am sorry, But don’t think you shouldn’t be too.<br/></p>
