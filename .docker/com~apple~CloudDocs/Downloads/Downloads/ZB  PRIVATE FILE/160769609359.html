                    <p>Sitting on the floor, staring.<br/>
I shifted my body in hope for comfort.<br/>
But as i settled into a new position I remembered that you can’t get physically comfortable when everything about you is uncomfortable. I could pile pillows, I could get the best of the best custom made mattress’s, goose feathered dooners and a thousand thread count Egyptian cotton quilts and still feel like I was sitting on a metal bench at sunrise in the middle of winter.<br/>
But it wasn’t about how comfortable I wasn’t or how uncomfortable I was at this stage it was why I was on the floor, it was what I was staring at that mattered.</p>

<p>I was on the floor of my bedroom and I was staring at hope.</p>

<p>It was my bedroom but unfortunately it wasn’t my hope. </p>

<p>Hope was something I used too feel, something I could grasp mentally in my mind so that physically I could push forward.</p>

<p>Hope used too be the core of my existence and the very thing that ties me down to this earth with ropes as thick as car tires and stronger than most metals. </p>

<p>Hope and fear were the two sides to me and the two halves of my mind and body, each pulling, one pulling down and the other pulling up, of course eventually it starts causing two polar opposite yet the same two ways of although different, singularly, they are ways in which we exert ones strength.</p>

<p>Strength is used while in fear, it’s used when hopeful. </p>

<p>Exerting ones strength is about as counteracting as it is contradicting.</p>

<p>In the sense I am describing it, paints a painfully accurate picture.</p>

<p>Imagine pulling up, while pushing down, with the exact same strength. </p>

<p>Pressure?.</p>

<p>Exerting is just using your strength in a negative or positive way throughout life, draining you. Exerting ones strength.</p>

<p><br/>
So I sit, uncomfortably on my bedroom floor staring blank faced at your hope.</p>

<p>As I lost mine recently.</p>

<p>I use my strength, in hope or out of <br/>
fear I’m no longer sure.</p>

<p>Exerting  myself. </p>

<p>For a hope that’s not mine on the floor, uncomfortably of a bedroom I don’t want, unless you’re in it, exhausted.</p>

<p>Fuck I hope your hope is for us…..</p>
