                    <p>When you walk into your bedroom.<br/>
Not a thing is in place.<br/>
Everything you need is out of sight.<br/>
All the things you thought were lost are scattered from corner to corner.</p>

<p>Your arms uncontrollably gesture in the awkward  &lsquo;why'  </p>

<p>No one is in the room and you know that, but still a necessary and uncontrollable reaction.</p>

<p>You want to feel angry, disrespected.<br/>
You want to scream at someone, tell then about how wrong this is.<br/>
How you would never do that, well, never intentionally.</p>

<p>But instead you find a patch of carpet, continue breathing, attempting some level of pace as your lungs inhale.. Exhale..</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve lost the need to quench your fists anymore, but somehow find that still, your questioning whether that is a good thing, or a bad.</p>

<p>Processing the emotions as they dance threw your skeleton.</p>

<p>I used to try and remember what they felt like, what it felt like to have a pain bury directly into your bone marrow.<br/>
Focused on the shooting lightning fast jolt that erupts your nervous system, always at random, convulsing, twitching and temporary shaken hands become just like any other bodily, one function you play games with yourself, waiting patiently, almost eagerly, trying to time each and every jolt.</p>

<p>But there you are.</p>

<p>Such beauty painted abruptly in only the recent memories, memories consisting of more pain than most will ever endure.<br/>
A pain, only love can create, both as unyielding than the other yet equal in damage.</p>

<p>Those memory&rsquo;s of your once profound love, the love whilst at its deepest, you would laugh at the very mention of failure and the possibilities seemed impossible and futile. </p>

<p><br/>
So obsessed with clearing the layers of heart aches off those eyes that completely swept me off my feet. I forgot for a minute, we are sitting on that patch of carpet, both upright and diagonal on this undersized diameter square.<br/>
You found a place to sit, <br/>
A place that you wouldn&rsquo;t trip on a grudge.<br/>
Guarantee not to kick your toes on regrets. Most importantly you can almost avoid all the lies that fall from wherever they needed from always exactly how the wanted them too. </p>

<p>The room is still there.<br/>
The mess is still there.</p>

<p>Sprawled in the most destructive manor. Wishing I could kill whatever hurt you so much.</p>

<p>My mind has morphed the people who ever caused you pain into sadistic little only because the answer is always, always the same.</p>

<p>Almost like when I find myself pretending like anything you have to say about me or what I did or didn&rsquo;t do is noted, valid or have any real impact on anything other than the walls around us.</p>

<p>The mess keeps me busy.<br/>
Iam not mad and I will never bring it up.</p>

<p>Just promise you will stop cleaning, talking and hiding my regrets in the piles of your mistakes and fucking see that I can no longer live in a room without the mess.<br/>
I know the mess.<br/>
I find comfort in it.</p>

<p>I will not leave my room, with echoes of your forgotten points guarded by my mess for it&rsquo;s the only place I can be near you.</p>

<p>I lose sight of you more and more everyday,</p>

<p>for you can&rsquo;t hide mess,<br/>
with mess.</p>
