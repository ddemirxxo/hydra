                    <p>Here we are again, in the slate you’ve promised to keep clean, the one you constantly promise will be fresh. Yet it seems to have been so dirtied the second, third, fourth, eighth time around that the stains are still prominent and familiar. For me, you will always take the form of the same rust, and we will always fall into the same patterns you vow to create differently. Unfortunately for you, history has finally rubbed itself on me enough for me to actually learn. Maybe others can learn something from my failings.</p><p>12 times I thought you had changed and a part of me still clings to some distant hope that some day you will. Maybe not exactly for me, but for whoever you cross paths with later in life. God forbid they’d have to tread the same treacherous waters that I did, because your convoluted waves of fear and uncertainty could drown an entire city and as strong as my love for you was, I had an even stronger will to live. </p><p>For a while we sang to a harmony unlike anything we had previously encountered, and the music we strummed was filled with possibility. Countless times believed you were prepared for the perimeters of what i expected you to give, the boundaries of what I could ask for and you’d give what you could without delay or restraint.</p><p>I refused to see what was true, though, that the most volatile things can blaze without warning, sizzle and waver into dust until they are no more. I hoped we would burn longer; I thought I could manage to keep the flames alive.</p><p>But fire, hungry and insatiable, consumes everything in it’s path. And you, You’re not just febrile. You are violent and flaring, and I’m afraid nothing will ever satiate you. Our chemistry sparked a flame I thought was unattainable by you, by anyone, and in that regard, I’ll admit I miss you. But we both know that with time, it’ll start to turn around and your promises will start to deteriorate, showing signs of your former intolerance, showing the edges of mine and your exhaustion, fuming not with smoke from kindling, but mist from the ice where you’ve turned parts of my heart cold.</p><p>So here is the part where I decide, and I’m not buying it anymore. There’s a cure and I know you have it, but you don’t want to get better. You’ve never wanted to heal. And I see it like the fire itself. This isn’t about me. It never has been. And damn if I will be splayed victim to your insanities again. I refuse to succumb to the torment you are predisposed to, the misery to which you’re accustomed, striking the people you love.</p><p>I do know that you mean it when you say you’re sorry, believe me, I know you well enough now to know sincerity when I hear it, but this time, you’re on your own. You were the necromancer of my heart, when all I was to you was a neck to romance. But I’ve grown to realise that I am more than just flesh to kiss, I’m more than just lips to bite and that there’s more to my body than just what’s between my legs. You made sense of the saddest parts of me, and that’s what will forever hurt the most. It was those sad parts, those jagged edges that pushed you into the arms of someone you thought was nothing but soft curves stitched together with good intentions, but it turns out that the arms you ran into are nothing but suffocating, and those soft curves have even sharper edges at the ends. </p><p>You made the bed, now you lay in it, because I’ve spent too many nights in mine, crying over why I couldn’t get over you, while you spent the same nights choosing whose turn it was to get under you.</p>
