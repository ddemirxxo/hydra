                    <h1>Permanent markers.</h1><p>If our lives were scrips.   If all our life experiances were recorded in writing and documented.</p><p>I bet mine would have been written with permanent marker.</p><p>Not intentionally of course, it would have just so happened that every 500,000 lives being documented, give or take it is enevitable that there would become a shortage in pencils. For this one day there would be a cut throat day of ordering and delivering of all the appropriate stationary that was custom made and specifically engerneered for the sole purpose of writing down and documenting scripts of each and every life that has lived and is living today.</p><p>On this day, the first since the first scripts ever writen.   A millennium of close calls of emergency stationary and secret paper stashes that came dangerously close to a halt.   Threatening the documentation of countless lives with unfathomable consequence.   Did this scriptwriter find himself with the last of the paper, limited but no chance of running out completely.   There was bearly days worth of led in the very last custom pencil, last one out of the last emergency stock yet weeks worth of writing to be kept. </p><p>He didnâ€™t even play with the idea of any stationary being delivered in time. </p><p>But what he did do is make the decision to continue writing the script. My fucking script. </p><p><br/></p><p>My life in details and my present as its happening and even my fucking future and fate.</p><p><br/></p><p>His decision. On this particular day, was to use a permenate marker on paper.</p>
