                    <p>Give them enough rope, they’ll hang themselves.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Most have heard this saying.<br/></p><p>I have heard it more so than any other. Didn’t think too much of it.<br/></p><p>Then Kristen Fallon, A girl who once meant the world to me, took her own life, she hung herself.<br/></p>I don’t like the quote all that much anymore, my perception has forever been shifted from the very concept.So much so, That even suicide for instance?If you had asked me any day before the 17th of August 2014 i would have said this, well, something along the lines of “it’s the most selfish act a person can do” or “how pathetic an act”How wrong i was, How arrogant and blind.To take your own life, for you to make a decision in a split second or planned for a day, takes fucking guts.Its one of the bravest things a person can do.
