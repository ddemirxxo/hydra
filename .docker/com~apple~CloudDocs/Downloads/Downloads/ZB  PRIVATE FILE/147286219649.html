                    <p>How many bones can I crush in this cave of heartless guilt?<br/>
How many ligaments do I have to pull??<br/>
Will it take me breaking my own neck in a fit of rage, twitching and tensing so tight that my spine gives way and snaps in two.<br/></p>

<p>What would it take for everyone around me to abandon me, just turn around and walk? Never glancing back and never to return??</p>



<p>just leave me alone in this cave to rot</p>
