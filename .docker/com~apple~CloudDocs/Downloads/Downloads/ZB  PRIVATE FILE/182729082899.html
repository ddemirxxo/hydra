I couldn’t imagine being any other way and quite frankly I wouldn’t know what to do with myself if any of the above stopped. For any amount of time. Ever.</p><p><br/></p><p>This is as good as it gets in terms of me expressing a dam thing.</p><p><br/></p><p>I feel all of this and haven’t even bothered to drift into my mind and connect a thought or situation that might be causing these daily physical nightmares. I don’t know what’s real and what’s not. I don’t know if my perception has warped what I think happened with that person I forgot to call back or if my reasoning for constantly triple booking myself is even believable </p><p><br/></p><p>If you still bother to get your hopes up.</p><p><br/></p><p>I think I know what I am feeling and I know what I think is probably wrong but I’ll never tell you that, it would destroy me until my tremors distract me again.</p>
