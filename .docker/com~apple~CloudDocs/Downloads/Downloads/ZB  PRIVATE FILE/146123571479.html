                    <p>Its weird you had to ask for me write about you.</p>

<p>You may not realise this but my days, all my decisions and a mojority of my actions are all based on, around and because of you.</p>

<p>Yes, good and bad.</p>

<p>You are like a cut tendon in the finger I use most to type. It’s not crippling, it’s impossible to ignore. It’s the reason i write the way i do but it’s frustrating as hell. It’s a constant but only affects me when i try and shake it, it shoots pain threw my whole being but it does it in that sensuous addictive way. I only ever get a glimpse of the scar but everyone else notices it before anything. </p>

<p>You weren’t worried about what i would write huh? You were more worried about me just writing about you in general.</p>

<p>I write to escape you. </p>

<p>Not in the way you first grasped, no.<br/>
But it is an escape for our fate, our hope and our possible.</p>

<p>You spend your days pulling at short straws and empty promises while i fill my days with fear and and inconsistencies that result in my empty promises faling back on my mouth like barb wire sewn threw my gums.</p>

<p>I never make sense when it comes to you do i?</p>
