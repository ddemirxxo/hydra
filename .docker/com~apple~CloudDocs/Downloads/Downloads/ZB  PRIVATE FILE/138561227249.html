                    I’ve witten enough letters throughout words strung in sentences because of you, because i’m without you or just because I can’t physically store any information in my mind when it’s cluttered with you. So many so, that my fingertips were to connect every one of the letters, hooking the loops and linking the letters in a awkward chain strung out in one direction, at length. I could confidently trace, from planet to star, moon to suns of at least one of the galaxies surrounding our own. <p>I’ve written pens, countless pens filled with endless ink on pages upon pages of notebooks and diaries that oceans would look like infireor puddles laying unnoticed and undisturbed next to the shear depth and ever crashing seas of ink i have flooded, pages i soaked after fistful of knuckle creasing expression i would not have found before i met you. </p><p> Keyboards have clicked and tapped away through endless nights and unseen days of a somewhat superior way, in comparison of getting my emotions onto a page, digital or not, recyclable or poison. I would dream of the faint clicking and tapping for days after forcing my fingertips to ease the boulder on my chest filled with more contradicting, confusing and counteracting feelings i have felt non stop since the day i met you in that side street, I hadn’t felt the need to know someone prior to then, i don’t remember what i used to feel when i had met people in my past. </p><p>From the first text, i mean just the one where we decided we should hag out, simple enough. Followed with a comment on my looks, A compliment i till find hard to swallow even now,</p><p><br/></p><p>I don’t know what it was, i don’t even know what is it, how it sparked or how it seemed to slowly fade out completely in my life only to still have no fucking idea what it is now.</p><p><br/></p><p>You’re one of few i would give the world too if i had the choice.</p><p>You’re one of few i get protective over, both in jealousy and in danger.</p><p>Your just a lot in all ways possible and i would like some space in my mind that doesn’t consist of everything from your smile, all the way down to that thing you do, that god dam smile while you look away, aways to your right biting your lip while you hide your face, all because you realize how much i am looking at you, still making eye contact while you chase your words in a circle for the third time. </p><p><br/></p><p>I miss you in every humanly possible way you could miss another human being. And thats coming from someone who wasn’t so human for a long time.</p>
