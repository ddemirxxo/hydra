                    <p>I have one of the most stubborn way of discussing a subject. <br/>
I have always had an &lsquo;unusual&rsquo; way of communicating my thoughts, well.. 'Fucking spastic&rsquo; would be a more realistic term. </p>

<p>I hate it.</p>

<p>I hate that for as long as I can remember I have to cover all and any possible assumptions and elaborate every example that I can remember.</p>

<p>I just got it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like I am dancing around the subject because I don&rsquo;t want to flat out just lay it down how i feel&hellip;.</p>

<p><br/>
I totally know it&rsquo;s fine lol</p>
