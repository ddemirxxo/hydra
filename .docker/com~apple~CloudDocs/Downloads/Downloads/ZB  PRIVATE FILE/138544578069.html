                    <h1>How long till you’re back?</h1><p>To begin, I’m sorry for carrying both our hearts on my back</p><p>like a suitcase when we both know that the last time you fucked the wrong person, it was me</p><p>I still haven’t returned the luggage tags</p><p>from the first person I kissed. And I apologize for always using the cordless phone to call you</p><p>because I’m too emotionally unstable to handle text messages.</p><p>Yes, my heart is irresponsible to the point that it can’t even show up for our dates in my chest on time, but</p><p>I’m so emotionally invested in you that every time you so much as look my way, I need therapy</p><p>Just to get me through the rest of the day.</p><p>You were a monsoon season that never ended.</p><p>The pot that boiled over because I watched it too much.</p><p>And even the sound of your loneliness is so familiar that I know it ten times better than my last four ringtones.</p><p>There are parts of you made up of hurt and pain but they are the parts you hide from me and sometimes even use to build up walls around your heart while you throw grenades at my chest.</p><p>I watch your thoughts sometimes, while you finish something ive said inside your mind because you always think I&rsquo;ve left something out of my story or there is something I am not telling you</p><p>Do you know how frustrating that is when you can literally see into my soul</p>
