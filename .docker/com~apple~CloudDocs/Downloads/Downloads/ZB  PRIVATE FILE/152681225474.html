                    <p>I wonder if all the people I’ve kissed can taste the emptiness I left on their lips.<br/>I hope not, I might not know how many people I’ve found comfort in recently but I do know that I don’t try to conceal the fight inside my chest.<br/>I wear every emotion as if it’s printed in bold on all my tall tee’s.</p><p>I always leave wearing an old shirt from a previous night of disorientated minds talking over each other until they break and kiss all their frustration into me, I must be up to my eye balls in the lies and false hope they force down my throat while grabbing at my skin like I’m all they want.</p><p>It’s not that I mind smothering my emptiness across the lips of others, I even let the lies and hopes they’ve mustered up in my arms fill the void in my chest, What does bother me is that I wear a shirt, my emotions bold and printed clearly on my tall tees and singlets but without fail by the time I leave one of them are wearing my fucking shirt.</p><p>So now I’m rummaging threw their mess of clothes that they forgot to take to the dry cleaners and dive into draws of straws and empty bags that kept them up long enough for me to turn up with promise of refiling them for a couple hours of forgetting the war in my mind. </p><p>All I want is a fucking shirt.</p><p>One of the shirts I left them in the last time I saw them, the bold text on the front is fading but still clear enough for me to be forced to remember what the last emotion i wore there to forget.<br/>I still smell the night from before on them, stale Giorio Armani mixed with whatever sweet perfume they wore that can no longer match to the bodies after weeks of my nose being clogged with cocaine and shame.<br/>I tiptoe around the mountains of foil and gather the pens I seem to have a never ending supply of, not that I can find one when I need.</p><p>They look so dam sweet and innocent sleeping, My shirt. My guilt. My shame, My pain covers their sheets while I close the door without making a sound, Practice makes perfect.</p><p><br/></p><p>I walk back to my car with a thousand missed calls and a million things to do wearing a shirt that’s not been washed and I am as faded as the emotion written across the front,</p><p> I cant even pinpoint why i felt that way, <br/></p><p>What day it was,</p><p>Who wore it before her or even have enough time to care before I am off too pile my day with so many unfinished ‘to do lists’ just to make more money than most, only to spend it on shirts.</p><p>I never have dirty washing anymore, but I will have a clean shirt for tomorrow by the end of today,<br/></p>
