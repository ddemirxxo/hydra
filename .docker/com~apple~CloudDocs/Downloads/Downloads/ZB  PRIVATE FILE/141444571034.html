                                    <h1>do you belong here...</h1>
                    <p>I have experienced some disturbing situations, places and people.</p>

<p>There isnt much I haven’t seen first hand and there isn’t much your imagination could muster up that would generally surprise me.<br/>
I don’t like to share the stories from my past.
I peobably won&rsquo;t share a majority of the events from my past I hold clearly in my regrettably clouded mind after all these years.</p>

<p>So here i am and all I see is blank faces, lost eyes and cracked skin.</p>

<p>Trolleys from all the major supermarkets, flipped upside down and scattered across front yard after front yard sprawled with abandoned children’s toys.</p>

<p> Once you realise you haven&rsquo;t once thought to even stop and look out for giggling children playing while neighbors lean over fences chatting about their day and that horrific news on chanel ten.
No, there is nothing but silence and awkwardly strung lengths of cotton, wire or string that&rsquo;s been wrapped around all and any available screws sticking out from broken walls or concrete, pulled tightly and tied to hold weight, i can imagine the ones who constructed it, using all their mite fighting years of weakened and drawn strength, exhausted they then knowing they don&rsquo;t have anywhere near enough pegs, the clothes ratio is always on the favor against pegs. <br/>
Blue pegs are always favored, since my first trip into this world it seemed as though yes, they are either green, blue or those wooden ones hoplessly hanging loosely just by the steel spring that once held it together and produced the clamp needed.</p>

<p>So, trolleys of all shapes and sizes, while they line the yards of the areas filled with forever neglected children’s toys scattered and of course the infrequent colors and varieties of pegs that struggle to hold week old clothes hung by the ones with lost eyes and cracked skin.</p>



<p>Ive never judged a book by its cover, never let my mind dislike a person based on society&rsquo;s and what we&rsquo;re taught on standards of living and I most definitely have not  held myself above another human being.</p>







<p></p>



<p>but</p>





<p><br/>
Its whats on the inside of those identical houses, with all the differneces that make them so indifferent.<br/>
The persona’s  that people take personally and the undesirable being rude and taunted by the desired.</p>

<p>Everyones got a story, a story that is so shitty that when you tell people you can see their faces go from disgusted to remorseful in just seconds so when and if you decide to tell them about whatever your drug of choice is that week, there is a much larger possibility of instead of being thrown aside with whats left of your pride back to the only place you feel you belong, instead you might get offered help of some kind or even better you won&rsquo;t be judged while you head back tp the trolley’ s and silence hiding amongst the decaying abandoned childrens toys…..</p>

<p>Your eye’s are lost.<br/>
But  that’s only because so is your mind and heart.</p>

<p>Your skin is breaking but its not yet cracked.</p>

<p>maybe hope isn’t wasted yet….</p>
Maybe you won&rsquo;t hurt anymore and maybe then you will stop hurting me too&hellip;&hellip;
