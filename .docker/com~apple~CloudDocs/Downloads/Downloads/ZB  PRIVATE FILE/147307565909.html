                                    <h1>The last laugh.</h1>
                    <p>Was never one you needed much of, you didn’t really mind if i heard that hurtful spiteful comment you mumbled as I walked out the door.</p>

<p>Because all you see is me,<br/>
Walking out the door.</p>

<p>Your perception on that is where you always fuck up.</p>

<p>But that’s not what we are talking about is it, no.</p>

<p>It’s ‘the last laugh’</p>

<p>So the muffled or snickered spiteful phrases you always conjured up that I did or didn’t hear weren’t all that important to you.</p>

<p>You have a list of sentences or questions before every fight.</p>

<p>Your focus is stronger than your heart in an argument.</p>

<p>That’s one situation we are opposite and I am the weaker one for once.</p>

<p>You are so determined to throw that sentence, that bundle of information you have moulded and shaped into a knife that have eaten at you for that day, week and sometimes months..</p>

<p>I can tell by the way and direction of the cuts from the knife made up of information hits and slits my body. I can tell if it’s been a day of focus because the knife is in my back, my neck or my knees.<br/>
A week is usually aimed for my heart but always hits my sternum, you don’t know this but the healing process for that is actually ten times longer, hurts more.<br/>
A month + knife usually comes in twos, one in both eyes. Both my lungs are punctured and my feet sawn off completely to prevent me walking out that door.</p>

<p>The knife formed from information is always easier than the questions.

The cuts bleed, scab, heal.

The questions are branded into my scull and the blood seems to drip into the shape of questions marks on everything I lose myself staring at for months at a time.

For someone who can&rsquo;t answer questions you have always had every jacket pocket filled, the side zipper of all your handbags and stash spots of questions for others.

Half the time your question is valid and as much as I hate to admit it, you don&rsquo;t know and you have a right to as my partner.

Why they are so much more painful than the knife is because the questions themselves aren&rsquo;t what outweighs the cons, it&rsquo;s not what the answer will do for me in the sense of being in the wrong or guilty. 

It&rsquo;s why the questions are always the same.

Why did I do that with her.
Why did you lie or fuck her.
How could you do that with her.
I know you what you wrote about her.

Or sometimes they are those but perspective flipped 180 degrees.

Why didn&rsquo;t you do this with me.
Why did you leave me alone.
Why aren&rsquo;t I good enough for that.
Why don&rsquo;t you write about me anymore.

Fuck, it didn&rsquo;t matter how you say it I would take my feet being sworn off with a knife of information while I attempt to breathe with multiple punctures in my lungs and scramble for a door dragging my legs behind me with knives replacing my eye sockets than hear these questions ever again&hellip;

They make me hate YOU more.
You never knew why huh, you have assumed maybe one or two decent reasons and one in sure is pretty close but no&hellip;

Do you want to know what I am screaming threw clenched fists and gritted teeth while you turn your knives and seemingly unaffected until of course you start one of your famous question air starts?

I want to ask you the same questions.
Just flipped from every perspective you have ever seen 360 degrees south.
