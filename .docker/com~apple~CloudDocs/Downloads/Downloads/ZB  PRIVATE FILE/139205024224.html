                    <p>I have more fault lines than the colouring books my 6 yr old has scribbled over.<br/>The only thing about me that’s straight to the point is my spine.<br/>and even that’s something my 6 yr old still has more of than I do.<br/>I’m sorry for the abrupt goodbye.<br/>but it had to be done.<br/>If you and someone have written more poems about how sad they make each other<br/>then it has to be done.<br/>If you have written more goodbye messages than, “good morning, beautiful”<br/>then it has to be done.<br/>We are so back and forth from “i miss you” to “fuck you”<br/>that I’m starting to get sea sick.<br/>I’ve been on 8 boats in my entire life.<br/>not one has made me as nauseas<br/>as our unsteady waves of uncertainty.<br/>I’m sorry I’ve become that sore thought<br/>that you have to wrestle with each and every night<br/>I’m sorry that I’m all words, no actions.<br/>but please don’t think that my leaving you<br/>is something that I want<br/>maybe I’m being selfish<br/>maybe I’m being inconsiderate<br/>but I cannot bare another day<br/>of hearing how I went from the girl who filled your stomach with butterflies<br/>to the girl who fills your heart with sorrow<br/>You weren’t something I was ready for<br/>You completely side swiped me<br/>that if we were an actual car crash<br/>i’d still be in the shop, having my damages be assessed. <br/>I didn’t plan on meeting anyone<br/>and I’m sure you didn’t either<br/>I’m sorry for meeting you<br/>because all I’ve done is made you a coffee filled with broken promises<br/>with a teaspoon of I’m sorrys<br/>when all you asked for was two sugars<br/>but I’m not sorry for meeting you<br/>you’ve made me experience a feeling that I’ll never understand<br/>that I’ll never want to<br/>but will spend the rest of my life trying TO understand</p><p>I swore I’d never get in over my head</p><p>but the day I met you<br/>I was already up to my ankles</p>
