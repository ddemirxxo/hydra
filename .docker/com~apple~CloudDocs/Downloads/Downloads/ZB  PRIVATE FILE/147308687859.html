                                    <h1>Every rose has its thorns</h1>
                    <p>I&rsquo;ve always liked that quote.</p>

<p>Although I&rsquo;m not that into roses and I wouldn&rsquo;t use &lsquo;thorn&rsquo; as a descriptive word for your negative traits.</p>

<p>You are ten times more beautiful than all the roses in the world and a sledge hammer sprinkled with rusty needles and blunt rocks to my scull would best describe the pain that&rsquo;s come with the beauty of you.</p>

<p>If I had a word that would do you justice in the sense of admiration and impeccable looks and sexual appeal the sledge hammer wouldn&rsquo;t seem so drastic.</p>

<p>I would take the sledge hammer on a daily basses if it meant I could call you mine each of those days.</p>
