                    <p>I stopped biting my tounge weeks ago.</p><p>I would spend more time biting than I would speaking, I guess half the reason I was biting was because I no longer saw the point in speaking&hellip;</p><p>You never did notice the blood.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know what I did before this painful habit started but I do know I&rsquo;ve never had a good memory, so instead I&rsquo;ll bite my tongue and let my own thoughts and feelings flow and type all the words I clamped in my mouth instead.</p><p>There is blood in my mouth and my hands shake.</p><p>I am freezing and I don&rsquo;t want to move because its sadly the only thing thats given me any sense of control reciently.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know where you are.</p><p> And you don&rsquo;t feel the need to tell me, I want to know for multiple reasons, so so bad. But we both know the simple fact of me wanting too want to know, for any reason is not reason enough for you. </p><p>My hands are shaking and I can taste blood. I can guess its the cold causing my hands to shake and that inflates my feelings of control, although I can bet my hands shake even while im sleeping these days. Anxiety, a topic irrelevant too the point so I&rsquo;ll take the first thing I learnt from you and get back too the relevant.</p><p>I fell inlove with your voice, not because the pitch is soothing or the distinct sound itself is comforting or reminds me of a safe place, no.</p><p>My hands shook and my teeth would pierce my tongue causing a sharp pain and a puddle of blood in the bottom of my mouth while I sat silently falling in love with your voice. </p><p>I used too let the sounds coming from your mouth form the distinguished words you so passionaly and confidently shared with no intention of pausing for a response or agreement, every couple of days. I would try and let myself hear what you were saying at least once a day but my toungue started caving and my hands shook so much it rattled my upper body, so I would fall in love with the sound while my body calculated the time and strength needed for my next attempt to listen to more than just the sound but the words too&hellip;..</p>
