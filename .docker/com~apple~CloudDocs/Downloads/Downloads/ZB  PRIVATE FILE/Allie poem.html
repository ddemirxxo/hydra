                    <h1>Miss kritselis</h1><p>Do you know that I truly believe in magic?</p><p>I believe because I have performed magic tricks a majority of my life, it was a natural talent I have always had with no idea where it originated from&hellip;</p><p>The day I thought I was at my best in the field of magic you came along and tricked me and stole a heart I didn&rsquo;t even know I had.</p><p>I had spent years and years trying to master my mind and find the heart I know I had hidden somewhere inside my ribcage. It wasn&rsquo;t fair that you found it before me and even less fair that you went and engraved your initials on it. </p><p>You made a conscious decision to love something inside me I didn&rsquo;t even know I had.</p><p>My mind has battled ever since, I don&rsquo;t know if its my self worth that is unable to believe a girl like you loves me. Not the idea of me, not the look of me but really generally fucking love me for me and as a whole. </p><p>There is still a small part in my mind that thinks you couldn&rsquo;t ever love me the way I love you and that magic doesn&rsquo;t exist </p><p>But all of me finally fucking knows without a doubt that my future is with you and everything I feared was a collection of insecuritys and self doubt doused in multiple beliefs that you deserve better. So fuck my head and keep my heart but promise me you will jump into the void of us and not let go of my hand?</p>
