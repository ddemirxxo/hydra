So don&rsquo;t misinterpret my frustration please&hellip;</p><p>Have you ever listened too someone, anyone, speak and just put your hands under your chin, shuffle into a more comfortable position and braced yourself for the inevitable pointless or narrow minded dribble too continue?</p><p>Of course you have, you were feeling patient that day or even had experienced such a good day yourself that you felt weirdly intruiged and almost encouraging of this one way conversation too continue?</p>
