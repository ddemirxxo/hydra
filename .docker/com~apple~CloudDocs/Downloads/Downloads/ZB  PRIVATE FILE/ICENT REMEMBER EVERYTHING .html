                    <h1>I can&rsquo;t remeber everything </h1><p>I can remember she always tilts her head to the left when shes about to kiss me. </p><p>I know she can never keep her hands to herself once she has.</p><p>I know that i have butterfly&rsquo;s in my stomach when i get a message from her so im not even going to bother trying to explain the feeling i have when she touches me.</p><p>I know she looks at me more than i have caught her looking at me and i know her shy smile is usually just her smiling at me unable to make eye contact at all.</p><p>I know she smells like rain and hotel body wash but i dont know why that is, or why it makes me dizzy when she burys her face into my neck.</p><p>I dont know how many inches of her body ive kissed but i know i would spend every night searching for new square inches of her.</p><p>We get lost in the covers most the time but the frustration on her face, when she decides to throw them on the floor, makes me smile and get nervous all at the same time. </p><p>She always knows what to say, i dont mean that how you think.. its just that she always thinks she&rsquo;s rite, the only thing that surprises me is her brattiness doesnt ever bruise my ego.</p><p>I nver get sick of talking to her but i am starting to go crazy with how much i talk about her.</p><p>So maybe i dont remeber every thing?</p><p>Fuck there isnt alot i remember in those months of drug induced haze&rsquo;s</p><p>But i remember the way it felt when i experienced all of the above&hellip;. </p><p>Truly crushed thinking nothing in the world would or could make me feel that way again.</p><p>Until i kissed her.</p><p>Stone cold sober, she nestled into my neck. Held my hand and kissed my face. No haze bar maybe the butterflys and nerves.</p><p>I love her so much it causes a sharp pain in my chest, a void in my stomach and sometimes my hands ache&hellip; </p><p>It sucks, but im going to marry her anyway.</p>
