                    <p>The taste of blood became a release. <br/>I was in the middle of the street on a average day, in a rush to do million things. I stopped dead in my tracks when I noticed, I could feel the usual dry mouth and the ache in my jaw from the constant clench it finds itself in. The taste of blood was untraceable, sure I know it&rsquo;s been a few days, maybe a week since I created pools of the acidic liquid under my tongue, seeping through my teeth and soaking my gums. I never did enjoy that, not every day anyway. But the taste gone altogether? Not even a linger of it from this morning. Sure it was a release.whether it was from a pierced lip, I never felt the initial puncture, my teeth aren&rsquo;t to take all the blame. My lips shouldn&rsquo;t always be so pressed. Sometimes it was even from my cheeks, i would concentrate so hard trying not to break my jaw that it was always to late before I realised I had turned my gums on either side of my mouth into chew toys. I never felt that either. So I&rsquo;m standing in the middle of the most congested parts of the city, tracing my teeth with my tongue searching for any signs of that familiar taste. fumbling around my mouth like playing murder in the dark, when it was actually pitch black. You could sense a presence, your intuition always aimed you in the rite direction and without a second thought you would find yourself running into the darkness as you secretly praised yourself for work you didn&rsquo;t do in a game that you hated, i never was a fan of the dark.</p><p><br/></p><p>Two blocks down and i find the urge to use any reflective surface to show myself my insane theory of simply being so used to the taste of blood that i simply couldn&rsquo;t taste it anymore. In the back of my mind i was more sure i had just chewed threw a nerve and my face was sloping considerably on one side and there was nothing i could do to about it. As i turn to see my reflection. I could see not only that my face was fine, also chances of blood visible to the now staring public. but i was perfectly normal. well, i was as much without blood or swollen cheeks then ever before. </p><p><br/></p><p>i knew then why, i figured it all out. </p><p>Next to me in the reflection, was no one. </p><p>I had escaped you and i was free of the taste in my mouth you left after every kiss, every put down and every tiny thing i lost so you felt found.</p><p><br/></p><p>And i wasn&rsquo;t going back. <br/></p>
